# An-Elementary-Introduction-to-Quantum-Cryptography
Quantum cryptography is one of the most researched fields of Information Theory. New theoretical cryptographic protocols are constantly being developed and realized experimentally.Fundamentally these cryptographic protocols are rendered secure by the laws of quantum mechanics. In this review, we introduce the concepts of quantum mechanics, the idea of measurement collapse, the uncertainty principle and some insightful solutions of the Schrodinger Equation. Then, we discuss the EPR paradox, Bellâ€™s Theorem leading up to Entanglement and Quantum Cryptography. Next, we examine the Standard Classifications of cryptographic Protocols, the no-cloning theorem, basic protocols like the BB-84 protocol and other similar protocols like bit commitment and entanglement based protocols. Finally, we review their experimental realizations and a few protocols beyond standard key distribution.
